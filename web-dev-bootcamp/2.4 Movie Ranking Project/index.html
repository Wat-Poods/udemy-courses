<h1>The Best Movies According to Pat</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>When Harry Met Sally</h3>
<p>We watch this every summer on the VHS tape at my in-law's house in Maine.</p>
<h3>Trolls World Tour</h3>
<p>It's my daughter's favorite movie right now, so it's mine now, too.</p>
<h3>Tommy Boy</h3>
<p>This is a movie I CANNOT wait to show my daughter... when she's old enough.</p>
